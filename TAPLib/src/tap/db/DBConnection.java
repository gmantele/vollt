	 * 	<b>SO PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWINGS AND TRY TO RESPECT IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN THE IMPLEMENTATIONS</b>
	 * </i></p>
	 *
	 * <h3>TAP_SCHEMA CREATION</h3>
	 * <p>
	 * 	This function MAY drop and then re-create the schema TAP_SCHEMA and all
	 * 	its tables listed in the TAP standard (TAP_SCHEMA.schemas, .tables, .columns, .keys and .key_columns).
	 * 	<i>All other tables inside TAP_SCHEMA SHOULD NOT be modified!</i>
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * 	The schema and the tables MUST be created using either the <b>standard definition</b> or the
	 * 	<b>definition provided in the {@link TAPMetadata} object</b> (if provided). Indeed, if your definition of these TAP tables
	 * 	is different from the standard (i.e. the standard + new elements), you MUST provide your modifications in parameter
	 *	through the {@link TAPMetadata} object so that they can be applied and taken into account in TAP_SCHEMA.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * <p><i>Note:
	 * 	DB names provided in the given TAPMetadata (see {@link TAPTable#getDBSchemaName()}, {@link TAPTable#getDBName()} and {@link TAPColumn#getDBName()})
	 * 	are used for the creation and filling of the tables.
	 *
	 * 	Whether these requests must be case sensitive or not SHOULD be managed by ADQLTranslator.
	 * </i></p>
	 *
	 * <h3>TAPMetadata PARAMETER</h3>
	 * <p>
	 * 	This object MUST contain all schemas, tables and columns that MUST be published. All its content will be
	 * 	used in order to fill the TAP_SCHEMA tables.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * 	Of course, TAP_SCHEMA and its tables MAY be provided in this object. But:
	 * </p>
	 * <ul>
	 * 		<li><b>(a) if TAP_SCHEMA tables are NOT provided</b>:
	 * 			this function SHOULD consider their definition as exactly the one provided by
	 * 			the TAP standard/protocol. If so, the standard definition MUST be automatically added
	 * 			into the {@link TAPMetadata} object AND into TAP_SCHEMA.
	 * 		</li>
	 * 		<li><b>(b) if TAP_SCHEMA tables ARE provided</b>:
	 * 			the definition of all given elements will be taken into account while updating the TAP_SCHEMA.
	 * 			Each element definition not provided MUST be considered as exactly the same as the standard one
	 * 			and MUST be added into the {@link TAPMetadata} object AND into TAP_SCHEMA.
	 *		</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * <p><i>Note: By default, all implementations of this interface in the TAP library will fill only standard columns and tables of TAP_SCHEMA.
	 * To fill your own, you MUST implement yourself this interface or to extend an existing implementation.</i></p>
	 *
	 * <p><i><b>WARNING</b>:
	 * 	(b) lets consider a TAP_SCHEMA different from the standard one. BUT, these differences MUST be only additions,
	 * 	NOT modifications or deletion of the standard definition! This function MUST be able to work AT LEAST on a
	 * 	standard definition of TAP_SCHEMA.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * <h3>FILLING BEHAVIOUR</h3>
	 * <p>
	 * 	The TAP_SCHEMA tables SHOULD be completely emptied (in SQL: "DELETE FROM &lt;table_name&gt;;" or merely "DROP TABLE &lt;table_name&gt;") before insertions can be processed.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * <h3>ERRORS MANAGEMENT</h3>
	 * <p>
	 * 	If any error occurs while executing any "DB" queries (in SQL: DROP, DELETE, INSERT, CREATE, ...), all queries executed
	 * 	before in this function MUST be canceled (in SQL: ROLLBACK).
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @param metadata			List of all schemas, tables, columns and foreign keys to insert in the TAP_SCHEMA.

	 * 	<p>
	 * 		A small number of rows are cached on the client side of the connection and when exhausted the next block of rows
	 * 		is retrieved by repositioning the cursor.
