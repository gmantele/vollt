/**
 * <p>VOSI - VO Support Interfaces - lets describe a minimal interface that VO web services should provide.</p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 	This interface aims to give information about the capabilities, the availability and the reliability of the service.
 * 	To reach this goal the 3 following endpoints (resources) should be provided:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * 	<li><b>Capability metadata:</b> list all available resources, give their access URL and a standard ID (helping to identify the type of resource).
 * 	                                More information related to the service itself (or about the VO standard it is implementing) may be provided.</li>
 *                                  
 * 	<li><b>Availability metadata:</b> indicate whether the service is available or not. It may also provide a note and some other information about
 * 	                                  its reliability, such as the date at which it is up, or since when it is down and when it will be back.</li>
 * 
 * 	<li><b>Tables metadata:</b> since some VO services deal with tabular data (in output, in input or queriable by a language like ADQL),
 * 	                            a VOSI-compliant service shall provide a list and a description of them.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 	Implementing the VOSI interface means that each service endpoint/resource must be described in the capability endpoint with an access URL and a standard VO ID.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>The standard IDs of the VOSI endpoints are the following:</p>
 * <ul>
 * 	<li><b>Capabilities:</b> ivo://ivoa.net/std/VOSI#capabilities</li>
 * 	<li><b>Availability:</b> ivo://ivoa.net/std/VOSI#availability</li>
 * 	<li><b>Tables:</b> ivo://ivoa.net/std/VOSI#tables</li>
 * </ul>
