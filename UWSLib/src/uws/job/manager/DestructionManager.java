/**
 * <p>Manages the automatic destruction of given jobs.</p>

 * 	Any job has a field named: destruction. It indicates when the job must be destroyed. Remember that destroying a job means
 * 	clearing all its resources (stopping it, deleting its result, ...) and removing it from its jobs list.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 	Each job must warn its jobs list of any change of its destruction time,
 * 	so that the jobs list can update the destruction manager with the method {@link #update(UWSJob)}.
 * 	Once the destruction time of a job is reached, it must be removed from this manager and
 *  from its jobs list (see {@link JobList#destroyJob(String)}).
