/**
 * <p>Let interpret and computing a frequency.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Frequency syntax</h3>
 *
 * <p>The frequency is expressed as a string at initialization of this object. This string must respect the following syntax:</p>
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>'D' hh mm : daily schedule at hh:mm</li>
 * 	<li>'W' dd hh mm : weekly schedule at the given day of the week (1:sunday, 2:monday, ..., 7:saturday) at hh:mm</li>
 * 	<li>'M' dd hh mm : monthly schedule at the given day of the month at hh:mm</li>
 * 	<li>'h' mm : hourly schedule at the given minute</li>
 * 	<li>'m' : scheduled every minute (for completness :-))</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p><i>Where: hh = integer between 0 and 23, mm = integer between 0 and 59, dd (for 'W') = integer between 1 and 7 (1:sunday, 2:monday, ..., 7:saturday),
 * dd (for 'M') = integer between 1 and 31.</i></p>
 *
 * <p><i><b>Warning:</b>
 * 	The frequency type is case sensitive! Then you should particularly pay attention at the case
 * 	when using the frequency types 'M' (monthly) and 'm' (every minute).
 * </i></p>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	Parsing errors are not thrown but "resolved" silently. The "solution" depends of the error.
 * 	2 cases of errors are considered:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * 	<li><b>Frequency type mismatch:</b> It happens when the first character is not one of the expected (D, W, M, h, m).
 * 	                                    That means: bad case (i.e. 'd' rather than 'D'), another character.
 * 	                                    In this case, the frequency will be: <b>daily at 00:00</b>.</li>
 *
 * 	<li><b>Parameter(s) missing or incorrect:</b> With the "daily" frequency ('D'), at least 2 parameters must be provided ;
 * 	                                             3 for "weekly" ('W') and "monthly" ('M') ; only 1 for "hourly" ('h') ; none for "every minute" ('m').
 * 	                                             This number of parameters is a minimum: only the n first parameters will be considered while
 * 	                                             the others will be ignored.
 * 	                                             If this minimum number of parameters is not respected or if a parameter value is incorrect,
 * 	                                             <b>all parameters will be set to their default value</b>
 * 	                                             (which is 0 for all parameter except dd for which it is 1).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Examples:</p>
 * <ul>
 * 	<li><i>"" or NULL</i> = every day at 00:00</li>
 * 	<li><i>"D 06 30" or "D 6 30"</i> = every day at 06:30</li>
 * 	<li><i>"D 24 30"</i> = every day at 00:00, because hh must respect the rule: 0 &le; hh &le; 23</li>
 * 	<li><i>"d 06 30" or "T 06 30"</i> = every day at 00:00, because the frequency type "d" (lower case of "D") or "T" do not exist</li>
 * 	<li><i>"W 2 6 30"</i> = every week on Tuesday at 06:30</li>
 * 	<li><i>"W 8 06 30"</i> = every week on Sunday at 00:00, because with 'W' dd must respect the rule: 1 &le; dd &le; 7</li>
 * 	<li><i>"M 2 6 30"</i> = every month on the 2nd at 06:30</li>
 * 	<li><i>"M 32 6 30"</i> = every month on the 1st at 00:00, because with 'M' dd must respect the rule: 1 &le; dd &le; 31</li>
 * 	<li><i>"M 5 6 30 12"</i> = every month on the 5th at 06:30, because at least 3 parameters are expected and so considered: "12" and eventual other parameters are ignored</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Computing next event date</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	When this class is initialized with a frequency, it is able to compute the date of the event following a given date.
 * 	The functions {@link #nextEvent()} and {@link #nextEvent(Date)} will compute this next event date
 * 	from, respectively, now (current date/time) and the given date (the date of the last event). Both are computing the date of the next
 * 	event by "adding" the frequency to the given date. And finally, the computed date is stored and returned.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Then, you have 2 possibilities to trigger the desired event:</p>
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>By calling {@link #isTimeElapsed()}, you can test whether at the current moment the date of the next event has been reached or not.
 * 	    In function of the value returned by this function you will be then able to process the desired action or not.</li>
 * 	<li>By creating a Timer with the next date event. Thus, the desired action will be automatically triggered at the exact moment.</li>
 * </p>
