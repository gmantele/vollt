# METADATA #
############

# [MANDATORY]
# Metadata fetching method.
# 
# The value of this key defines the way the library will get the list of all
# schemas, tables and columns to publish and all their metadata (e.g. utype,
# description, type, ...).
# 
# In its current state, the library proposes three methods:
#    1/ Parse a TableSet XML document and load its content into the database
#       schema TAP_SCHEMA (note: this schema is first erased and rebuilt by the
#       library).
#    2/ Get all metadata from the database schema TAP_SCHEMA.
#    3/ Build yourself the metadata of your service by creating an extension of
#       tap.metadata.TAPMetadata. This extension must have either an empty
#       constructor or a constructor with exactly 3 parameters of type
#       UWSFileManager, TAPFactory and TAPLog ; if both constructor are
#       provided, only the one with parameters will be used.
# 
# For the two first methods, it is also possible to specify an extension of
# tap.metadata.TAPMetadata which will wrap a default TAPMetadata objects created
# using the specified methods (i.e. XML tableset or TAP_SCHEMA). In this way, it
# is possible to get the "default" metadata from an XML file or the database
# and then add/remove/modify some of them, or to change the output of the
# 'tables' resource. The extension of tap.metadata.TAPMetadata must have at
# least one constructor with the following parameters: (TAPMetadata) or
# (TAPMetadata, UWSFileManager, TAPFactory, TAPLog).
#  
# Allowed values: xml, xml {myTAPMetadata}, db, db {myTAPMetadata}
#                 or a full class name (between {}).

# The file path must be either an absolute local file path or a file path
# relative to WebContent (i.e. the web application directory in which there are
# WEB-INF and META-INF).

#
# Mapping between TAP_SCHEMA ADQL names and their names in the database.
# 
# Any property named exactly (case sensitive) like TAP_SCHEMA items will be
# considered as a mapping between its ADQL name and its DB name.
#
# Examples: "TAP_SCHEMA = TAP_SCHEMA2"
#           or "TAP_SCHEMA.columns.column_name = name"
#
# The property value MUST be NOT qualified. Just the item name is required.
# The value will be used as provided (with the same case).
#
# Note:
#     The column dbName in the database TAP_SCHEMA declaring the standard

# LOG FILES #
#############

# [OPTIONAL]

#                will be appended in the file 'service.log' inside the root
#                directory of this service (cf property 'file_root_path').
#
#     * slf4j: wrapper for SLF4J (https://www.slf4j.org). All log messages will
#              be forwarded to SLF4J. It is up to the implementor to add the
#              suitable JAR files in the Java class-path. Exactly two JAR files
#              are expected by SLF4J to work as expected:
#                  - slf4j-api-{version}.jar (the main API)
#                  - and the slf4j-{binding}-{version}.jar.
#              Depending on the chosen SLF4J binding, you may also add another
#              JAR file (e.g. Log4J, LogBack, ...) in the Java class-path.
#              A configuration file might also be needed. There, it will be
#              possible to configure the  the following loggers:
#                  - "tap.service" (general/root purpose log),

#                  - and "tap.service.DB" (DB actions).

#     * {...}: a custom logger. A class name MUST be provided
#              (between {...}). The specified class must reference
#              an implementation of tap.log.TAPLog. This implementation
#              must have at least one constructor with a single parameter of

# just define a VOTable format with the short form `votable`. 
# 
# It is also possible to define a custom Separated Value format, different from

#                 If expressed in bytes, the file size will be checked when
#                 uploading the file on disk. Thus, when the uploading file
#                 starts to exceed the set limit, it will be no longer uploaded
#                 and the whole request will be immediately rejected.
#                 On the contrary, if the limit is expressed in rows, it will
#                 be tested only when ingesting the whole uploaded file
#                 (whatever is its size) in the database ; so, after it has been
#                 uploaded. As soon as, the rows insertion in the database
#                 exceeds the limit, the query is rejected.
#                 Consequently, a very huge file could potentially be
#                 completely uploaded before being rejected if this property is
#                 expressed in rows. Then, it is very important to set the
#                 property `upload_max_request_size` limiting the size of a
#                 whole HTTP request in order to better preserve your machine
#                 from running out of disk space.
# 
# Default: upload_max_db_limit=1000000r (i.e. 1 million rows)
upload_max_db_limit = 1000000r


# [OPTIONAL]
# Maximum allowed size for a whole HTTP multipart request (i.e. request with
# uploads).
# 
# This limit MUST be expressed in bytes. Thus, you have to suffix the numeric
# value by "B", "kB", "MB" or "GB". Here, unit is case sensitive. No other
# storage unit is allowed.
# 
# A negative value means there is no restriction on this limit. Float values are
# not allowed.
# 
# Warning: It is highly recommended to set this property in order to prevent
#          exceeding the disk storage space/quota (especially if
#          `upload_max_db_limit` is not set or is set in rows).

# syntax: Frame RefPos Flavor. In other words, it must be a string of exactly 3
# parts. Each of this part is a single value, a list of allowed values
# or a * meaning all values. A list of values must be indicated between
# parenthesis and values must be separated by a pipe.
# 
# Allowed values for Frame are: ICRS, FK4, FK5, J2000, ECLIPTIC, GALACTIC
#                               and UNKNOWNFRAME.
# Allowed values for RefPos are: BARYCENTER, GEOCENTER, HELIOCENTER, LSR,
#                                TOPOCENTER, RELOCATABLE and UNKNOWNREFPOS.
# Allowed values for Flavor are: CARTESIAN2, CARTESIAN3 and SPHERICAL2.
# 
# If the special value NONE is given instead of a list of allowed coordinate
# systems, no coordinate system will be allowed. And if the list is empty, any
# coordinate system will be allowed.
# 
# By default, any coordinate system is allowed.

# USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS (UDFs) #

# [OPTIONAL]
# Comma-separated list of all allowed UDFs (User Defined Functions).
# 
# Each item of the list must have the following syntax: [fct_signature],
# [fct_signature, className] or [fct_signature, className, description].
# fct_function is the function signature. Its syntax is the same as in
# TAPRegExt. className is the name of a class extending UserDefinedFunction.
# An instance of this class will replace any reference of a UDF written in an
# ADQL function with the associated signature. A class name must be specified if
# the function to represent has a signature (and more particularly a name)
# different in ADQL and in SQL. description is the human description of the
# function to be displayed in the /capabilities of the TAP service. It must be
# written between double quotes.
# 
# Example: udfs = [ivo_healpix_index(hpxOrder integer, ra double, dec double)
#                  -> bigint, {adql.query.operand.function.healpix.HealpixIndex}

#                     specified position at the given Healpix order."],

# If the list is empty (no item), all unknown functions are forbidden. And if
# the special value ANY is given, any unknown function is allowed ; consequently
# the unknown ADQL functions will be translated into SQL as they are in ADQL.

# Default: no unknown function is allowed.

#     * nothing (default): no /examples endpoint.
#     * name or relative path of a file: this method MUST be chosen if the
#       endpoint content is a JSP file. This file MUST be inside the directory

#       on the endpoint

# If you want a custom /examples endpoint (i.e. you do not)
# want to forward/redirect to a file/URL), you can create a class which
# implements TAPResource AND VOSIResource. The function getName() must return
