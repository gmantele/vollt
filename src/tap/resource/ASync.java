/**
 * <p>Asynchronous resource of a TAP service.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	Requests sent to this resource are ADQL queries (plus some execution parameters) to execute asynchronously.
 * 	Results and/or errors of the execution are stored on the server side and can be fetched by the user whenever he wants.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	This resource is actually another VO service: a UWS (Universal Worker Service pattern).
 * 	That's why all requests sent to this resource are actually forwarded to an instance of {@link UWSService}.
 * 	All the behavior of UWS described by the IVOA is already fully implemented by this implementation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>This resource is also representing the only jobs' list of this UWS service.</p>
 *
 * <p>The UWS service is created and configured at the creation of this resource. Here are the list of the most important configured elements:</p>
 * <ul>
 * 	<li><b>User identification:</b> the user identifier is the same as the one used by the TAP service. It is provided by the given {@link ServiceConnection}.</li>
 * 	<li><b>Jobs' lists:</b> the /async resource of TAP contains only one jobs' list. Its name is "async" and is accessed directly when requesting the /async resource.</li>
 * 	<li><b>Job execution management:</b> an execution manager is created at the creation of this resource. It is queuing jobs when a maximum number of asynchronous jobs
 * 	                                     is already running. This maximum is provided by the TAP service description: {@link ServiceConnection#getNbMaxAsyncJobs()}. Jobs are also queued if no more DB
 * 	                                     connection is available ; when connection(s) will be available, this resource will be notified by {@link #freeConnectionAvailable()} so that the execution manager
 * 	                                     can be refreshed.</li>
 * 	<li><b>Backup and Restoration:</b> UWS jobs can be saved at any defined moment. It is particularly useful when an grave error occurs and merely when the service must be restarted.
 * 	                                   Then, at the creation of this resource, the jobs are restored. Thus, the restart has been transparent for the users: they did not lose any job
 * 	                                   (except those at the origin of the grave error maybe).</li>
 * 	<li><b>Error logging:</b> the created {@link UWSService} instance is using the same logger as the TAP service. It is also provided by the given {@link ServiceConnection} object at creation.</li>
 * </ul>
