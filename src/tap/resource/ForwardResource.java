	 * <ol>
	 * 	<li><b>a file inside WebContent</b> if the given URI has no scheme (e.g. "tapIndex.jsp" or "/myFiles/tapIndex.html").
	 * 	                                    The URI is then an absolute (if starting with "/") or a relative path to file inside the WebContent directory.
	 * 	                                    In this case the request is forwarded to this file. It is neither a redirection nor a copy,
	 * 	                                    but a kind of inclusion of the interpreted file into the response.
	 *                                      <i>This method MUST be used if your page/content is a JSP.</i></li>
	 * <li><b>a local file</b> if a URI starts with "file:". In this case, the content of the local file is copied in the HTTP response. There is no interpretation. So this method should not be used for JSP.</li>
	 * <li><b>a distance document</b> in all other cases. Indeed, if there is a scheme different from "file:" the given URI will be considered as a URL.
	 *                                In this case, any request to the TAP home page is redirected to this URL.</li>
	 * </ol>
	 *
	 * <p><b>Important note:</b>
	 * 	The 1st option is applied ONLY IF the path of the TAP servlet is NOT the root path of the web application:
	 * 	that's to say <code>/*</code>. In the case where a URI without scheme is provided though the servlet path
	 * 	is <code>/*</code>, this function will resolve the full path on the local file system and apply the
	 * 	2nd option: write the file content directly in the response. Note that will work only in cases where the
	 * 	specified file is not a JSP or does not need any kind of interpretation by the function
	 * 	{@link RequestDispatcher#forward(javax.servlet.ServletRequest, javax.servlet.ServletResponse)}.
