#     * nothing (default): the default home page provided by the library (a XML
#                          document listing all available job lists).
#     * name or relative path of a file: this method MUST be chosen if the new
#                                        home page is a JSP file. This file

#     * a URL: here, a redirection toward this URL will be made at each request

#     * a class name: the class name of an extension of
#                     uws.service.actions.ShowHomePage which must replace the
#                     default home page action. This class MUST have at least

#######
# JOB #
#######

# [MANDATORY]
# Class describing the execution of all jobs managed by the job list specified
# as prefixed of the property name.
# 
# This property must be a class name (given between {...}). It must reference
# an extension of uws.job.JobThread. This implementation must have at least a
# constructor with one parameter of type uws.job.UWSJob.
jobs.job_thread = 

# [OPTIONAL]
# List of all expected parameters.
# 
# The value of this property is expected to be a comma separated list of
# parameters. At least a name without any space character is expected. Limits
# about each parameter MAY be provided. Below are described all types of
# parameter definition that are supported in this property file:
# 
#     * Just a name:
#                                paramName
#     * String parameter:
#         [ paramName , modif? , string , "default" , / regular_expr / i ]
#     * Numeric parameter:
#          [ paramName , modif? , numeric , default , minimum , maximum ]
#     * Duration parameter:
#          [ paramName , modif? , numeric , default , minimum , maximum ]
#     * Custom:
#                   [ paramName , { aPackage.ClassName } ]
# 
# It is not mandatory to declare all expected parameters in this list. Even non
# listed parameters will appear in the job description. However any parameter
# name provided in this list will be recognized case insensitively among the
# parameters of a job. For instance, if the list contains the parameter foo and
# the user has provided the parameters foo=bar&FOO=stuff when creating a job,
# the library will consider them as the same. It will take the last given value
# and will report this parameter in its job description as foo=stuff.
# 
# All attributes except the name and the type (or the class name) are optional.
# They can be omitted which implies they will be set to their default value ;
# generally null. Here are more details about each attribute:
# 
# modif? is a boolean flag aiming to indicate whether the value of the parameter
# can be modified after initialization of the job. Any value (case insensitive)
# among the following list is interpreted as true ; any other value as false:
# true, t, yes and y. If this flag is omitted it will be by default set to true
# (i.e. the parameter can be modified after initialization).
# 
# The regular expression must be enclosed by /. It can contain any character
# except /. If a such character has to be provided anyway, it can be done by
# doubling it. For instance: /foo//bar/i. The letter i after the regular
# expression is optional. It indicates that the regular expression must be
# evaluated case insensitively.
# 
# The default, minimum and maximum values of numeric and duration parameters
# must be valid numeric values. For a numeric, any kind of numerical value is
# accepted. For a duration, only positive or zero long/integer values are
# accepted. If one of these values is omitted it will be considered as null
# (i.e. no limitation in the case of the minimum and maximum).
# 
# A duration value (default, minimum, maximum and even a user value provided
# when submitting/updating a job) must be a positive or zero long/integer value
# eventually followed by a unit. Without a unit, by default the duration will be
# considered as being expressed in milliseconds. The supported unit suffixes are
# the following (case sensitive): milliseconds (or ms), seconds (or sec or s),
# minutes (or min or m), hours (or h), days (or D), weeks (or W ; = 7 days),
# months (or M ; = 30 days) and years (or Y ; = 365 days).

# 
# By default, the UWS library supports the XML (content-type: text/xml) and JSON
# (content-type: application/json) serializations. If the given MIME-Type is
# unknown or is not provided, the default behavior is to describe the jobs into
# the XML format.

# ADDITIONAL UWS ACTIONS #

# Comma-separated list of additional UWS actions.

# exactly this name):
#   Show UWS Home Page (0),
#   List Jobs (1),
#   Add Job (2),
#   Set UWS Parameter (3),
#   Destroy Job (4),
#   Get Job (5),
#   Get Job Parameter (6)
#   and Set Job Parameter (7).
# With this property, you can add or replace a custom actions to your UWS
# service.
# 
# To merely add a new action, the syntax is:
# 
#                             index:className
# 
# The index with the following : are optional. If an index is specified, the
# action will be inserted at this position in the list of all actions (standard
# and custom) of the UWS service ; above the index of all UWS standard actions
# is specified. If no index is specified, the : separator MUST be omitted, and
# the new action will be added at the end of the UWS actions list.
# 
# To replace an existing action, no index should be specified (if there is, it
# will be ignored) and the implementation of the function UWSAction.getName()
# MUST return the exact (case sensitivity is enabled) name of the action to
# replace.
# 
# Important note:
# An action name is used only to identify internally a UWS action. To
# effectively trigger the execution of an action you must carefully implement
# the function UWSAction.match(...). The whole list of actions (standard and
# custom) is evaluated in the creation order. So if a standard action matches a
# request, the additional actions will never be evaluated ; the evaluation of
# the standard actions must all fail before getting a chance to evaluate any of
# the custom actions. That's why you have the possibility to insert an action
# wherever you want in the list, and to replace existing actions.
# 
# Each item of the list MUST be the name of a class implementing
# uws.service.actions.UWSAction. This class MUST have at least one constructor
# with exactly one parameter of type uws.service.UWSService.

# By default, this list is empty ; only the standard UWS actions exist.
